I opened executable in Hex editor and removed the extra executable binary added above the video data.
Video data was encoded by AVC as visible in executable and was having .h263 encoding as visible on codec information of VLC while playing.
Input file created for python is too large (more than 25 MB) to upload on github. Not enabled large objects.
Output files are present in output folder which are not properly divided as needed.
Python code is not complete to divide files in correct form.
