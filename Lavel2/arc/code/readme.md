There is nothing over internet to related arc to any easily accessible video converter.
arc video search misleads to many different unrelated executables and formats, old archive and other.

It has two chanllenges:
1) Knowing what the video file contains in it, is itself a hard task to crack. 
2) Then writing a codec, is another hard task.

By the way I managed to get first hard task done, am able to know and retrieve what the file contains through a trial version 
of a software named Sira View Plus.

Writing a codec for it is a big task, by the way seeing the hex of arc file shows that it contains same size frames. One can try to
convert them but it is having a significant level of difficulty. I am uploading the videos exported by Sira View which are having
watermark as I am only having trial version.

Sira View Plus can be downloaded from below link:
