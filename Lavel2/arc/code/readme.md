There is nothing over internet to related arc to any easily accessible video converter.
arc video search misleads to many different unrelated executables and formats, old archive and other.

It has two chanllenges:
1) Knowing what the video file contains in it, is itself a hard task to crack. 
2) Then writing a codec, is another hard task.

By the way I managed to get first hard task done, am able to know and retrieve what the file contains through a trial version 
of a software named Sira View Plus.

I am uploading the videos exported by Sira View which are having watermark as I am only having trial version.

Sira View Plus can be downloaded from below link:
